## Past Work

Technical Support Specialist/Co-ordinator** at Free Geek. Managed paid workers 
and volunteers, and provided Level 3 support, in a department providing hardware
and Linux based software tech support for up to 2000 end users. Outside of core
duties my initial focus was on rebuilding a chaotic paper based system that 
often lead to delays of several weeks. By introducing standardized procedures 
and efficient use of an electronic ticketing system I was able to achieve a 
target turn around time of three days or less. Later my focus was on developing
software tools for internal use including a backup and system replication tool
and a number of  libraries and tools for interacting with the ticket system's 
API. In addition I did extensive organizational development outside my
department and assisted in systems administration where needed.
