Resident of Portland Oregon with 18 years experience of working in I.T.

I am currently seeking work in DevOps, Development or Support Engineering with a coding component.

I bring with me a deep background in Linux, open source and internet technologies as well as a diversity of other experience (I started out as as a dancer and performance artist) particularly in the non-profit sector.

My background is in systems and network administration and, more latterly support, but my current focus is on coding and development, especially in Python.
