Monomatapa
==========

**A Micro-CMS using Flask.**

Monomotapa:
    a city whose inhabitants are bounded by deep feelings of friendship, so that
    they intuit one another's most secret needs and desire. For instance, if one
    dreams that his friend is sad, the friend will perceive the distress and 
    rush to the sleepers rescue.

    (Jean de La Fontaine, *Fables choisies, mises en vers*, VIII:11 Paris, 
    2nd ed., 1678-9)

A micro cms written using the Flask microframework, orignally to manage my 
personal site. It is designed so that publishing a page requires no more than
dropping a markdown page in the appropriate directory (though you need to edit
a json file if you want it to appear in the top navigation). 

It can also display its own source code and run its own unit tests.

The name 'monomotapa' was chosen more or less at random (it shares an initial
with me) as I didn't want to name it after the site and be typing import 
paulmunday, or something similar, as that would be strange.
